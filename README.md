# word_Count
This method relies on the number of spaces present in the input string to count the number of words
as every word in a sentence is separated by a space. The function countWord() is defined which takes
the text present in the textarea and counts the number of spaces present in it. The input text in the 
textarea is selected by using the getElementById() method.
The drawback of this method is that multiple spaces between words would be counted as multiple words,
hence it may cause the word count to be unreliable.
